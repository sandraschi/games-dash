# Phase 12: Timewasters Category 💎⏰

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Priority**: MEDIUM (But dangerously addictive!)  
**Date**: 2025-12-03  
**Warning**: ⚠️ May cause loss of productivity ⚠️

## Vision

A category of **dangerously addictive match-3 puzzle games** that are:
- **Visually gorgeous** (sparkles, particles, satisfying animations)
- **Mechanically simple** (match 3, things drop down)
- **Psychologically devastating** ("just one more game...")
- **Mind destroying** (hours disappear into the void)

**The Evil**: Start with "I'll just play one round" → 3 hours later you're still playing.

---

## Core Mechanic: Match-3 with Gravity

### Basic Concept
1. Grid of colored gems/candies/objects (8×8 or 10×10)
2. Swap adjacent pieces
3. Match 3+ in a row (horizontal/vertical)
4. Matched pieces disappear
5. Pieces above drop down (gravity!)
6. New pieces spawn at top
7. Cascading combos possible!
8. Score points, reach target, repeat forever...

### Why It's Addictive
- **Simple to learn** (swap, match, repeat)
- **Immediate feedback** (satisfying animations)
- **Variable rewards** (sometimes big combos!)
- **Just one more** (always another move possible)
- **Progression** (levels, upgrades, achievements)
- **No penalty for failure** (try again immediately)

**Psychology**: Exploits dopamine reward cycle!

### Power-Ups

**Two Power-Ups Combined**:

- Huge point bonuses
- **The Hook**: Players chase these moments

### Visual Effects (The Pretty Part)
