Chess players everywhere scream at screen\n5. Movie continues, oblivious\n\n**Why Chess Players Hate This**:\n- Breaks immersion instantly\n- Shows lazy research (5 minutes would fix it)\n- Trying to show intelligence, displays stupidity\n- It's like showing 'genius mathematician' who can't add 2+2\n\n**The Meme**:\n```\nMovie Villain: 'I'm 10 moves ahead'\n*Board shows mate in 1 for opponent*\nChess Players: 'You're 1 move behind, genius'\n```\n\n**How to Fix It**:\n- Hire chess consultant ($500-2000)\n- Use actual famous game positions\n- Or don't show board closeup!\n- **Cost**: 0.001% of film budget"

Board set up wrong: Priceless.'\n\n'Every chess movie: ✅ Cool music ✅ Dramatic lighting ✅ Intense stares ❌ Legal positions ❌ Sensible moves ❌ Correct board orientation'\n\n'Hollywood: Hire ONE chess player. Just one. We'll work for pizza.'\n\n'*Pauses movie to check board* It's not even check. Day ruined.'\n\n**Why It Matters**:\nFor chess players, seeing board setup wrong is like seeing actor hold gun upside down or drive car from passenger seat. It's so obviously wrong that it destroys suspension of disbelief.\n\n**The Frustration**: It's SO easy to fix! Google 'chess board setup' takes 30 seconds. But directors often don't care because most audience won't notice."
