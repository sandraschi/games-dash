                <h2>📜 The Rules</h2>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Have more pieces of your color on the board when the game ends.</p>
                
                <h3>How to Play</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Play on an 8×8 board</li>
                    <li>Black plays first</li>
                    <li>Place a piece on an empty square that flips one or more opponent pieces</li>
                    <li>Pieces are flipped when they're between your new piece and another of your pieces</li>
                    <li>You can flip pieces in any of the 8 directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)</li>
                    <li>If you can't make a valid move, your turn is skipped</li>
                    <li>Game ends when neither player can move</li>
                    <li>Player with most pieces wins!</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Flipping Rules</h3>
                <p>When you place a piece, all opponent pieces in a straight line (in any direction) between your new piece and another of your pieces are flipped to your color. You must flip at least one piece to make a valid move.</p>

                <h2>🎯 Strategy Tips</h2>
                
                <h3>Early Game</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Avoid corners early:</strong> Corners are powerful, but playing them too early can backfire</li>
                    <li><strong>Control edges:</strong> Edge squares are valuable but risky</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimize flips:</strong> Sometimes it's better to flip fewer pieces to maintain control</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mid Game</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Corner strategy:</strong> Corners are permanent - once captured, they can't be flipped</li>
                    <li><strong>Edge control:</strong> Control edges to limit opponent's options</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Keep your options open - having many valid moves is key</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>End Game</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Count pieces:</strong> When few moves remain, count to see who's winning</li>
                    <li><strong>Force bad moves:</strong> Make moves that force opponent into disadvantageous positions</li>
                    <li><strong>Corner capture:</strong> Corners become crucial in the endgame</li>
                </ul>
