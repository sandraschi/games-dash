## [2.5.2] - 2026-06-09 - Bugfixes: static serving, chess AI color, TDC crash, engine launch

### Fixed
- **Static file serving**: games now served at `/` (root) instead of `/games-collection/`, fixing 12 404 errors on absolute-path resources (`/styles.css`, `/js/api-config.js`, etc.)
- **Chess AI wrong color**: forced FEN side-to-move to match the requested player, fixing Stockfish playing white when it should play black
- **Tri-Dimensional Chess crash**: `handleSelection()` was missing the `target` parameter from the click handler (ReferenceError). Added proper null guards on all `target.userData` access paths and wrapped in try/catch with status bar error messages.
- **Caching**: added `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers for JS/CSS/HTML files so game updates aren't stuck behind browser cache
- **AI engine launch**: `start.ps1` now launches Stockfish (10001), KataGo (10002), and YaneuraOu (10003) as hidden processes alongside the gateway
- **npx resolution**: replaced `Get-Command npx` with direct `npm run dev` via `cmd.exe /c` to avoid Notepad++ file association issue
- **UTF-8 BOM**: saved start.ps1 with UTF-8 BOM encoding for correct PowerShell parsing on Windows
- **Em dash**: replaced em dash (`—`) with ASCII hyphen (`-`) in start.ps1 per fleet standard
- **`$args` collision**: renamed to `$npxArgs` to avoid overwriting PowerShell's automatic `$args` variable
- **`web_sota/start.ps1`**: removed stale `PYTHONPATH` and old `games_mcp.web_bridge:app` reference, updated to `server:app`

### Added
- Engine servers auto-launched by `start.ps1` (Stockfish, KataGo, YaneuraOu)
- `/api/config` endpoint for `api-config.js` discovery (AI server host, port mappings)
- `-NoEngines` flag on `start.ps1` for gateway-only mode
- `-Dashboard` flag for optional Vite frontend start

## [2.5.1] - 2026-06-09 - Tauri Desktop, Docker Consolidation, FastAPI Gateway

- INSTALL.md: 5 install options including mcpb and Tauri NSIS
- glama.json: fleet standard $schema format with dual transport
- llms.txt + llms-full.txt: proper LLM index structure

### Fixed
- mcp_client.ts: now uses JSON-RPC over /mcp instead of non-existent /tools/ endpoints
- App.tsx: uses new REST API /api/v1/status for dashboard
- TypeScript typecheck passing
- Removed unused API_PORT variable
