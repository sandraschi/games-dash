```powershell
cd games-app
.\START_EVERYTHING.ps1
```

Opens browser at `http://localhost:9876`

**Option 2: Docker**

```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

Opens browser at `http://localhost:9876`

## Backend Servers

Three Python servers run the AI engines:

- `stockfish-server.py` - Port 9543 (Chess)
- `shogi-server.py` - Port 9544 (Shogi)
- `go-server.py` - Port 9545 (Go)
- `multiplayer-server.py` - Port 9877 (WebSocket multiplayer)

Web server: Port 9876

## Features

- ScummVM integration for classic adventure games

## Notes

- Built entirely with Cursor IDE's auto-agent in ~4 hours
- No fancy frameworks - vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- AI backends use asyncio/aiohttp
- Dockerized for easy deployment
- Multiplayer uses local WebSocket server (see `multiplayer-server.py`)
