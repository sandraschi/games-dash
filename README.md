## Why This Exists

This started as an experiment: **how far can agentic engineering go?** Not "vibecoding" — deliberate, iterative, push-the-limits AI-assisted development. The result is a full-featured games platform with 150+ games, seven AI engines, 3D physics, and an MCP API. All built in days, not months. This repo is the artifact of that question.

**The AI opponent irony.** Every AI engine here — Stockfish, KataGo, Edax, MoHex, GNU Backgammon — was built by human researchers over decades. Not a single line of their game-playing code was written by AI. They're classical algorithms: alpha-beta pruning, Monte Carlo tree search, neural network evaluation. Yet they are *artificial intelligence* in the truest sense. This project respects that enormous human effort and wraps it in a modern interface so it doesn't rot in a terminal.

**Agent-accessible.** Every game is also an MCP tool. Claude, Cursor, or any MCP client can analyze chess positions, play a round of Hex, or run a Go analysis. The `/mcp` endpoint exposes the entire collection programmatically. Games become building blocks for autonomous agents.

**Local first.** Everything runs on your machine. No account creation, no data collection, no ads, no monthly subscription. Start the server, open the browser, play.

**107+ game research library.** OpenSpiel is an academic framework from Google DeepMind. This is the only browser UI for it — you can play Phantom Tic-Tac-Toe, Liar's Dice, Breakthrough, and 100+ other games that exist nowhere else as clickable web pages.

**3D physics for the sake of it.** Jenga with Cannon.js physics. Mahjong with Three.js orbit controls. The kind of thing you build when you're not optimizing for mobile battery life.

## Game AI Engines

All engines run in Docker containers (orchestrated via `docker-compose.yml`) or natively on Windows. Each engine has a Python aiohttp server wrapper exposing a REST API on its port.

| Engine | Game | Version | License | Port | Windows Native | Docker Required? |
|--------|------|---------|---------|------|----------------|------------------|
| Stockfish | Chess | 16 | GPL-3.0 | 10780 | ✅ | No |
| YaneuraOu | Shogi | 9.40 (Deep ORT-CPU) | GPL-3.0 | 10781 | ✅ | No |
| KataGo | Go | 1.16.5 (OpenCL) | MIT | 10782 | ✅ | No |
| Edax | Othello/Reversi | 4.6 | GPL-3.0 | 10785 | ✅ `engines/data/` | No |
| OpenSpiel | 119 games | 1.6.15 | Apache-2.0 | 10787 | ✅ (pip) | No |
| GNU Backgammon | Backgammon | 1.08 | GPL-3.0 | 10786 | ❌ | **Yes** |
| MoHex | Hex | Built from source | LGPL-3.0 | 10775 | ❌ | **Yes** |

**Start all engines:**

```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

**Naked-PC alternative** (run engine servers directly without Docker):

```powershell
uv run python engines/stockfish-server.py
uv run python engines/shogi-server.py
uv run python engines/go-server.py
uv run python engines/edax-server.py
uv run python engines/gnubg-server.py
uv run python engines/open_spiel_server.py
uv run python engines/mohex-server.py
```

---

## Quick Install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/sandraschi/ai-game-chest
cd ai-game-chest
.\start.ps1
```

This launches all seven AI engines + the game gateway. Opens `http://localhost:10987/`.

For other install methods (manual, Docker, Tauri desktop), see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
