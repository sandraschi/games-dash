                <h2>📜 The Rules</h2>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.</p>
                
                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each player has 5 ships:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Carrier (5 cells)</li>
                            <li>Battleship (4 cells)</li>
                            <li>Cruiser (3 cells)</li>
                            <li>Submarine (3 cells)</li>
                            <li>Destroyer (2 cells)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Place ships horizontally or vertically on your 10×10 grid</li>
                    <li>Ships cannot overlap or be placed diagonally</li>
                    <li>Ships cannot touch each other (optional rule)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Players take turns calling out coordinates (e.g., "B5")</li>
                    <li><strong>Hit (✕):</strong> You hit an enemy ship</li>
                    <li><strong>Miss (○):</strong> You hit empty water</li>
                    <li>When all cells of a ship are hit, it's <strong>sunk</strong></li>
                    <li>First to sink all enemy ships wins!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>🎯 Strategy Tips</h2>
                
                <h3>Ship Placement</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Spread out:</strong> Don't cluster ships together</li>
                    <li><strong>Mix orientations:</strong> Use both horizontal and vertical placements</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid patterns:</strong> Don't place ships in obvious rows/columns</li>
                    <li><strong>Edge placement:</strong> Ships on edges are harder to find</li>
                    <li><strong>Corner strategy:</strong> Corners can be safe or risky - use wisely</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Search Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Checkerboard pattern:</strong> Efficient way to search the board</li>
                    <li><strong>After a hit:</strong> Search adjacent cells systematically</li>
                    <li><strong>Ship hunting:</strong> Once you find a ship, determine its orientation</li>
                    <li><strong>Probability:</strong> Center squares are more likely to contain ships</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Advanced Tactics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Salvo mode:</strong> Fire multiple shots per turn (if allowed)</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory:</strong> Track your shots to avoid repeating</li>
                    <li><strong>Pattern recognition:</strong> Learn opponent's placement tendencies</li>
                    <li><strong>Bluffing:</strong> React to hits/misses to mislead opponent</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>💡 Common Mistakes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clustering ships:</strong> Makes them easy to find once one is discovered</li>
                    <li><strong>Predictable patterns:</strong> Placing ships in rows/columns is too obvious</li>
                    <li><strong>Forgetting shots:</strong> Keep track of where you've already fired</li>
                    <li><strong>Giving up after first hit:</strong> One hit doesn't mean the game is lost</li>
                    <li><strong>Ignoring probability:</strong> Some areas are statistically more likely to contain ships</li>
