                <h2>🎯 Strategy</h2>
                <h3>Probability</h3>
                <p>Each outcome has a 50% chance (18 even combinations, 18 odd combinations out of 36 total). This makes it a pure game of chance with no skill element.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Since it's 50/50, there's no mathematical advantage to either bet</li>
                    <li>Some players use betting systems (Martingale, etc.), but these don't change the odds</li>
                    <li>The key is bankroll management - set limits and stick to them</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>

                    <li>Enjoy the game for its simplicity and cultural significance</li>
