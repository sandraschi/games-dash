            <h2>📋 Rules of Bridge</h2>
            
            <h3>Basic Setup</h3>
            <p>Bridge is played by 4 players in two partnerships. Partners sit opposite each other. A standard 52-card deck is used, with cards ranked A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2. Suits are ranked: Spades (highest), Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs (lowest).</p>
            
            <h3>Deal & Bidding</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deal:</strong> Each player receives 13 cards</li>
                <li><strong>Bidding:</strong> Players bid to determine the contract (trump suit and number of tricks)</li>
                <li><strong>Contract:</strong> The partnership that wins the bid must take at least that many tricks</li>
                <li><strong>Declarer:</strong> The player who first bid the final suit becomes the declarer</li>
                <li><strong>Dummy:</strong> Declarer's partner becomes the dummy and lays down their hand</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Play</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Opening Lead:</strong> The player to the left of declarer leads the first card</li>
                <li><strong>Tricks:</strong> Each player plays one card in turn, following suit if possible</li>
                <li><strong>Trump:</strong> If a trump suit was bid, trump cards beat other suits</li>
                <li><strong>Winning:</strong> Highest card of the led suit (or highest trump) wins the trick</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <p>Points are awarded based on the contract level, suit, and whether the contract was made. Making a contract scores points; failing to make it gives points to the opponents. Game is 100 points; slam bonuses are awarded for bidding and making 6 or 7 tricks.</p>

            <h2>🎯 Strategy & Tactics</h2>
            
            <h3>Card Counting</h3>
            <p>Keep track of which cards have been played. This helps you know what cards remain and make better decisions. Count high cards, suit distributions, and honor cards.</p>
            
            <h3>Signaling</h3>
            <p>Use standard signals to communicate with your partner (without speaking, which is illegal). Common signals include attitude signals (high card = like the suit), count signals (even/odd number of cards), and suit preference signals.</p>
            
            <h3>Finessing</h3>
            <p>A finesse is a technique to win a trick with a lower card by playing it when a higher card is in a favorable position. Learn when to finesse and when not to—it's a key skill in bridge.</p>
            
            <h3>Suit Management</h3>
            <p>Manage your suits carefully. Establish long suits, set up winners, and avoid blocking suits. Sometimes you need to lose a trick early to win more tricks later.</p>
            
            <h3>Defense</h3>
            <p>When defending, work with your partner to defeat the contract. Lead through strength, lead up to weakness. Count declarer's tricks and try to prevent them from making their contract.</p>
            
            <h3>Declarer Play</h3>
            <p>As declarer, plan your play before the first trick. Count your winners and losers. Look for ways to establish extra tricks through finesses, long suits, or endplays.</p>

            <h2>🗣️ Bidding Systems</h2>
            
            <h3>Standard American</h3>
            <p>The most common bidding system in North America. Features 5-card majors, natural bidding, and standard conventions like Stayman and Blackwood. Good for beginners and intermediate players.</p>
            
            <h3>Acol</h3>
            <p>Popular in the UK and Commonwealth countries. Features 4-card majors and a more flexible approach. Different from Standard American but equally effective.</p>
            
            <h3>2/1 Game Forcing</h3>
            <p>An advanced system where a 2-level response in a new suit is game-forcing. More precise than Standard American but requires more partnership agreement and experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Precision Club</h3>
            <p>An artificial system where 1♣ shows a strong hand. Very popular in Asia and among expert players. Requires extensive partnership discussion and practice.</p>
            
            <h3>Common Conventions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stayman:</strong> 2♣ response to 1NT asks for 4-card major</li>
                <li><strong>Blackwood:</strong> 4NT asks for aces, 5NT asks for kings</li>
                <li><strong>Gerber:</strong> 4♣ asks for aces (alternative to Blackwood)</li>
                <li><strong>Transfer Bids:</strong> Artificial bids to show specific hands</li>
                <li><strong>Takeout Double:</strong> Shows support for unbid suits</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Bidding Principles</h3>
            <p>Bid your longest suit first. Support partner's suit with 3+ cards. Show your strength through your bidding level. Use conventions to exchange information efficiently. Remember: bidding is a conversation, not a monologue.</p>
