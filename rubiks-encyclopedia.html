        <div class="encyclopedia-section">
            <h2>👤 The Inventor: Ernő Rubik</h2>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p><strong>Ernő Rubik</strong> was born on July 13, 1944, in Budapest, Hungary, during World War II. His father, Ernő Rubik Sr., was an aircraft engineer, and his mother, Magdolna Szántó, was a poet. Growing up in post-war Hungary, Rubik developed a fascination with geometry, architecture, and three-dimensional objects.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Education & Career</h3>
            <p>Rubik studied architecture at the Budapest University of Technology (1962-1967) and later studied sculpture at the Academy of Applied Arts and Design. In 1971, he became a professor at the Budapest College of Applied Arts, where he taught interior design and architecture.</p>
            
            <p>As a professor, Rubik was always looking for ways to help his students understand spatial relationships and three-dimensional geometry. He believed that hands-on learning was essential for understanding complex concepts.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>The Moment of Inspiration</h3>
                <p>In the spring of 1974, Rubik was working on a problem: how to create a structure where individual parts could move independently without falling apart. He wanted to design a teaching tool that would help students understand how parts of a whole can move independently while remaining connected.</p>
                
                <p>He began experimenting with wooden blocks, rubber bands, and paper clips. After several weeks of trial and error, he created a 3×3×3 cube with 26 smaller cubes (called "cubies") that could rotate on three axes. The first prototype was made of wood and held together with rubber bands and paper clips.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The first time Rubik scrambled his cube, it took him over a month to solve it.</strong> He had created a puzzle that even he, the inventor, found challenging!</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Life After the Cube</h3>
            <p>Despite the cube's massive success, Rubik remained humble and continued his work as an educator. He used his wealth to support education and innovation in Hungary. He founded the Rubik Studio, which designs furniture and games, and continues to work on new puzzles and educational tools.</p>
            
            <p>Rubik has received numerous awards, including the Kossuth Prize (Hungary's highest cultural award) and honorary doctorates from universities worldwide. He remains active in promoting education and innovation, particularly in mathematics and engineering.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Quote from Ernő Rubik:</strong> "The cube is a very simple object, but it's also very complex. It's a paradox. The simplicity is in the structure, but the complexity is in the possibilities."</p>

            <h2>🔢 Mathematical Aspects</h2>
            
            <p>The Rubik's Cube is a fascinating mathematical object that has inspired research in group theory, combinatorics, algorithms, and computational complexity.</p>
            
            <h3>Group Theory</h3>
            <p>The Rubik's Cube can be mathematically described as a <strong>group</strong> - a fundamental concept in abstract algebra. Each move on the cube is an element of the Rubik's Cube group.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>The Rubik's Cube Group</h4>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Rubik's Cube group is the group of all legal positions reachable from the solved state through valid moves.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Group Size:</strong> 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (approximately 4.3×10¹⁹) positions</li>
                    <li><strong>Generators:</strong> The 6 basic face turns (U, D, F, B, R, L) and their inverses</li>
                    <li><strong>Group Structure:</strong> A subgroup of the symmetric group S₄₈ (permutations of 48 facelets)</li>
                    <li><strong>Subgroups:</strong> The cube has many interesting subgroups, including corner-only and edge-only groups</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Permutations and Combinations</h3>
            
            <div class="method-card">
                <h4>Corner Permutations</h4>
                <p>The 8 corner pieces can be arranged in <strong>8! = 40,320</strong> ways. However, only half of these are reachable (20,160 valid positions) due to parity constraints.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="method-card">
                <h4>Edge Permutations</h4>
                <p>The 12 edge pieces can be arranged in <strong>12! = 479,001,600</strong> ways. Again, only half are reachable (239,500,800 valid positions) due to parity.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="method-card">
                <h4>Orientation Constraints</h4>
                <p><strong>Corner Orientations:</strong> Each corner can be oriented in 3 ways, but the sum of all corner orientations must be divisible by 3. This gives 3⁷ = 2,187 valid corner orientations.</p>
                <p><strong>Edge Orientations:</strong> Each edge can be oriented in 2 ways, but the sum must be even. This gives 2¹¹ = 2,048 valid edge orientations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Total Positions Calculation</h4>
                <p>The total number of reachable positions is:</p>
                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: monospace;">
                    (8! × 3⁷ × 12! × 2¹¹) / 12 = 43,252,003,274,489,856,000
                </p>
                <p><strong>Why divide by 12?</strong> The division accounts for:</p>
                <ul>

            <div class="record-box">
                <h4>God's Number = 20</h4>
                <p>In 2010, after 35 years of research and using Google's computing resources, mathematicians proved that <strong>God's Number is 20</strong>.</p>
                <p>This means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every scrambled cube can be solved in 20 moves or fewer</li>
                    <li>Some positions require exactly 20 moves (called "superflip" positions)</li>
                    <li>The proof required checking all 43+ quintillion positions</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>God's Number by Metric</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quarter-Turn Metric (QTM):</strong> 26 moves (counting 90° turns only)</li>
                    <li><strong>Half-Turn Metric (HTM):</strong> 20 moves (counting 90° and 180° turns)</li>
                    <li><strong>Slice-Turn Metric (STM):</strong> 20 moves (includes slice moves)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most cubers use HTM, which is why God's Number is commonly stated as 20.</p>

                <h4>Optimal Solving Algorithms</h4>
                <p><strong>Kociemba's Algorithm:</strong> Two-phase algorithm that can find near-optimal solutions (typically 19-20 moves) in seconds.</p>
                <p><strong>Thistlethwaite's Algorithm:</strong> Four-phase algorithm that guarantees solutions in 52 moves or fewer (theoretical, not optimal).</p>
                <p><strong>IDA* (Iterative Deepening A*):</strong> Used to find optimal solutions, but computationally expensive for full solves.</p>

                <h4>Computational Complexity</h4>
                <p><strong>Finding a Solution:</strong> The problem of finding any solution is in NP (nondeterministic polynomial time).</p>
                <p><strong>Finding Optimal Solution:</strong> Finding the shortest solution is NP-hard, meaning it's computationally difficult.</p>
                <p><strong>Practical Solving:</strong> Modern algorithms can find near-optimal solutions (19-20 moves) in seconds using heuristics and lookup tables.</p>

            <h3>Symmetry and Automorphisms</h3>
            <p>The Rubik's Cube has <strong>24 rotational symmetries</strong> (the cube can be rotated in 24 different ways that preserve its structure).</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">

            <h3>Mathematical Properties</h3>
            
            <div class="method-card">
                <h4>Parity</h4>
                <p>The cube has <strong>parity constraints</strong> that prevent certain positions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Corner Parity:</strong> Corner permutation parity must match edge permutation parity</li>
                    <li><strong>Orientation Parity:</strong> Sum of corner orientations must be divisible by 3</li>
                    <li><strong>Edge Parity:</strong> Sum of edge orientations must be even</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These constraints mean only 1/12 of all possible arrangements are actually reachable.</p>

            <div class="method-card">
                <h4>Conjugacy Classes</h4>
                <p>Many cube positions are <strong>conjugate</strong> to each other - they have the same structure but in different locations. Understanding conjugacy helps in algorithm development and pattern recognition.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="method-card">
                <h4>Commutators and Conjugates</h4>
                <p><strong>Commutators:</strong> Sequences like [A, B] = A B A' B' are fundamental building blocks of cube algorithms. They allow precise control over specific pieces.</p>
                <p><strong>Conjugates:</strong> Sequences like A B A' allow applying algorithm B in a different context. Most speedcubing algorithms are conjugates of simpler sequences.</p>
