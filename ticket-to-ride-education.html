        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p><strong>Ticket to Ride</strong> was designed by <strong>Alan R. Moon</strong> and first published in 2004 by <strong>Days of Wonder</strong>. The game was inspired by Moon's love of train travel and his desire to create an accessible gateway game that would introduce new players to modern board gaming.</p>
            
            <h3>Inception</h3>
            <p>Alan R. Moon had been designing games since the 1980s, but Ticket to Ride was his breakthrough hit. The game was inspired by his travels across the United States by train and his fascination with the golden age of rail travel. Moon wanted to create a game that was:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easy to learn (gateway game)</li>
                <li>Quick to play (30-60 minutes)</li>
                <li>Visually appealing</li>
                <li>Strategic but not overwhelming</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Gateway Game</h3>
            <p>Ticket to Ride is considered one of the most successful <span class="highlight">gateway games</span> - games that introduce new players to modern board gaming. It bridges the gap between traditional family games (like Monopoly) and more complex strategy games. The game's success helped popularize modern board gaming and introduced millions of players to the hobby.</p>

            <h2>Game Rules</h2>
            
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>The goal is to score the most points by:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Claiming routes</strong> between cities (points based on route length)</li>
                <li><strong>Completing destination tickets</strong> (bonus points for connecting two cities)</li>
                <li><strong>Building the longest continuous path</strong> (10 bonus points)</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player receives <strong>45 colored train pieces</strong> and <strong>4 train cards</strong></li>
                <li>Each player draws <strong>3 destination tickets</strong> and must keep at least <strong>2</strong></li>
                <li>Place <strong>5 train cards</strong> face-up on the table</li>
                <li>The rest form a draw pile</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>On your turn, you must do <strong>one</strong> of the following:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Draw Train Cards:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Draw 2 cards from the face-up cards (if you take a wild card, that's your only card)</li>
                        <li>OR draw 2 cards from the face-down deck</li>
                        <li>You can mix face-up and face-down cards</li>
                        <li>If you take a face-up card, it's immediately replaced</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Claim a Route:</strong>

                        <li>Score points based on route length</li>
                        <li>Some routes are <strong>double routes</strong> (two parallel routes) - only one player can claim each</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Draw Destination Tickets:</strong>

                        <li>Return unwanted tickets to the bottom of the deck</li>
                        <li>You can only do this once per game</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Route Colors</h3>
            <p>Routes come in different colors:</p>
            <ul>

            <h2>Strategy & Tips</h2>
            
            <h3>Basic Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balance route claiming and card collection:</strong> Don't claim routes too early - build up cards first</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on destination tickets:</strong> Complete your tickets, but don't take too many risky ones</li>
                <li><strong>Block opponents:</strong> Claim routes that opponents need for their tickets</li>
                <li><strong>Watch the train count:</strong> Don't let the game end when you're not ready</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Destination Tickets</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep tickets that overlap:</strong> If multiple tickets share cities, you can complete them together</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluate risk vs. reward:</strong> High-point tickets are tempting but risky if incomplete</li>
                <li><strong>Don't take too many:</strong> Each incomplete ticket hurts your score</li>
                <li><strong>Plan your route:</strong> Think about the path you'll need to complete tickets</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Route Claiming</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Claim double routes early:</strong> If you need a route, claim it before opponents block you</li>
                <li><strong>Save wild cards:</strong> Use them for long routes or when you're short on a color</li>
                <li><strong>Watch for bottlenecks:</strong> Some cities are critical connection points</li>
                <li><strong>Claim gray routes strategically:</strong> They're flexible but can be blocked by any color</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Card Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Collect sets of colors:</strong> Focus on 2-3 colors rather than spreading out</li>
                <li><strong>Watch face-up cards:</strong> Take cards opponents need to block them</li>
                <li><strong>Don't hoard too many:</strong> You can only hold 7 cards (in some variants)</li>
                <li><strong>Time your claims:</strong> Claim routes when you have enough cards, not too early</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>End Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Control the end:</strong> If you're ahead, try to end the game quickly</li>
                <li><strong>Complete tickets:</strong> Make sure you finish your destination tickets before the game ends</li>
                <li><strong>Longest route:</strong> If you're close, try to claim the longest route bonus</li>
                <li><strong>Count trains:</strong> Keep track of how many trains each player has left</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start simple:</strong> Focus on completing 2-3 destination tickets rather than many</li>
                <li><strong>Collect cards first:</strong> Build up a hand of train cards before claiming routes</li>
                <li><strong>Watch opponents:</strong> See what routes they're collecting cards for</li>
                <li><strong>Plan ahead:</strong> Think about which routes you'll need for your tickets</li>
                <li><strong>Don't hoard:</strong> Claim routes when you can - don't wait too long</li>
                <li><strong>Block strategically:</strong> If an opponent needs a route, consider claiming it first</li>
                <li><strong>Balance risk:</strong> High-point tickets are great, but incomplete ones hurt</li>
                <li><strong>Have fun:</strong> Ticket to Ride is meant to be accessible and enjoyable!</li>
