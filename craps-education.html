                <h2>📖 Rules</h2>
                <h3>Basic Gameplay</h3>
                <p>Craps is a dice game where players bet on the outcome of dice rolls. The game has two main phases:</p>
                
                <h3>Come-Out Roll (First Roll)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Natural (7 or 11):</strong> Player wins immediately</li>
                    <li><strong>Craps (2, 3, or 12):</strong> Player loses immediately</li>
                    <li><strong>Point (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10):</strong> This number becomes the "point" and the game enters the Point Phase</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Point Phase</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Player continues rolling until either:</li>
                    <li><strong>Point is rolled again:</strong> Player wins</li>
                    <li><strong>7 is rolled:</strong> Player loses (this is called "sevening out")</li>
                    <li>Any other number: Continue rolling</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Betting Options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pass Line:</strong> Bet that the shooter will win (most common bet)</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't Pass:</strong> Bet that the shooter will lose</li>
                    <li><strong>Come Bet:</strong> Similar to Pass Line, but made after the point is established</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't Come:</strong> Opposite of Come Bet</li>
                    <li><strong>Odds Bet:</strong> Additional bet on the point with no house edge (best bet in casino)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>🎯 Strategy</h2>

                    <li><strong>Don't Pass + Odds:</strong> Even lower house edge (0.7% on Don't Pass)</li>
                    <li><strong>Come + Odds:</strong> Same as Pass Line, can be made multiple times</li>
                </ul>

                </ul>

                <h3>Basic Strategy</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start with Pass Line or Don't Pass bet</li>
                    <li>Once point is established, take maximum odds (if available)</li>
