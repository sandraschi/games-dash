                <h2>📖 Rules</h2>
                <h3>Basic Gameplay</h3>
                <p>Baccarat is a card game where you bet on which hand will have a value closer to 9: Player or Banker. You can also bet on a Tie.</p>
                
                <h3>Card Values</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ace:</strong> Worth 1</li>
                    <li><strong>2-9:</strong> Face value</li>
                    <li><strong>10, J, Q, K:</strong> Worth 0</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Hand values use modulo 10 - if total exceeds 9, drop the tens digit (e.g., 15 becomes 5).</p>

                <h3>How to Play</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place your bet on Player, Banker, or Tie</li>
                    <li>Dealer deals two cards to Player and two to Banker</li>
                    <li>If either hand totals 8 or 9 (natural), no more cards are drawn</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, third card rules apply:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Player:</strong> Draws third card if hand value is 0-5</li>
                            <li><strong>Banker:</strong> Draws third card based on complex rules (depends on Player's third card)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Hand closest to 9 wins</li>
                    <li>If both hands are equal, Tie bets win</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Betting Options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Player:</strong> Pays 1:1 (even money)</li>
                    <li><strong>Banker:</strong> Pays 0.95:1 (5% commission - best bet!)</li>
                    <li><strong>Tie:</strong> Pays 8:1 (or 9:1 in some casinos)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Third Card Rules (Simplified)</h3>
                <p><strong>Player draws if:</strong> Hand value 0-5</p>
                <p><strong>Banker draws if:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Banker 0-2: Always draws</li>
                    <li>Banker 3: Draws unless Player's third card is 8</li>
                    <li>Banker 4: Draws if Player's third card is 2-7</li>
                    <li>Banker 5: Draws if Player's third card is 4-7</li>
                    <li>Banker 6: Draws if Player's third card is 6-7</li>
                    <li>Banker 7: Stands (no third card)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>🎯 Strategy</h2>
                <h3>House Edge</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Banker bet:</strong> 1.06% house edge (BEST BET!)</li>
                    <li><strong>Player bet:</strong> 1.24% house edge</li>
                    <li><strong>Tie bet:</strong> 14.4% house edge (AVOID!)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Best Strategy</h3>
                <p><strong>Always bet on Banker!</strong> It has the lowest house edge of any casino game bet (except craps odds bets).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Banker wins slightly more often than Player (due to drawing rules)</li>
                    <li>The 5% commission is still better than Player's 1.24% edge</li>
                    <li>This is the mathematically optimal strategy</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Betting Systems</h3>
                <p>Like roulette, betting systems don't work in baccarat. However, since Banker has such a low house edge, some players use conservative progression systems. Still, <strong>no system can overcome the house edge long-term</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Betting on Tie (terrible odds - 14.4% house edge)</li>
                    <li>Betting on Player instead of Banker</li>
                    <li>Following "patterns" - each hand is independent</li>
                    <li>Not accounting for the 5% commission on Banker wins</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Smart Play</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always bet Banker (lowest house edge)</li>
                    <li>Never bet Tie (terrible odds)</li>
                    <li>Set a budget and stick to it</li>
                    <li>Remember: Each hand is independent - no patterns exist</li>
                    <li>Enjoy the simplicity - baccarat is one of the easiest casino games to play</li>
                </ul>
