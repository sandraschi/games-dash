                <h2>📜 The Rules</h2>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Score the most points by placing tiles, claiming features (roads, cities, monasteries, fields), and completing them.</p>
                
                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with one tile face-up</li>
                    <li>Each player has meeples (followers) in their color</li>
                    <li>Draw tiles randomly</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Turn Sequence</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Draw and place a tile:</strong> Must connect to existing tiles (edges must match)</li>
                    <li><strong>Optionally place a meeple:</strong> On the tile you just placed (road, city, monastery, or field)</li>
                    <li><strong>Score completed features:</strong> If you complete a road, city, or monastery, score it and get your meeple back</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Scoring</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Roads:</strong> 1 point per tile when completed</li>
                    <li><strong>Cities:</strong> 2 points per tile (4 for large cities with pennants)</li>
                    <li><strong>Monasteries:</strong> 9 points when surrounded by 8 tiles</li>
                    <li><strong>Fields:</strong> Scored at game end, 3 points per completed city touching the field</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>🎯 Strategy Tips</h2>
                
                <h3>Meeple Management</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Don't waste meeples:</strong> You only have 7 - use them wisely</li>
                    <li><strong>Quick returns:</strong> Place on features you can complete quickly</li>
                    <li><strong>Save for fields:</strong> Fields score big at the end but tie up meeples</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Tile Placement</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Block opponents:</strong> Prevent them from completing their features</li>
                    <li><strong>Steal features:</strong> Connect to opponent's incomplete features to share points</li>
                    <li><strong>Create opportunities:</strong> Set up features you can claim later</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Feature Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Majority matters:</strong> Player with most meeples on a feature gets all points</li>
                    <li><strong>Share strategically:</strong> Sometimes sharing is better than losing</li>
                    <li><strong>Watch the board:</strong> Count remaining tiles to plan your moves</li>
                </ul>
