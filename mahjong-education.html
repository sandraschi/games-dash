            <h2>📜 History of Mahjong</h2>
            
            <h3>Chinese Origins</h3>
            <p>Mahjong (麻将) originated in China during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912). The game evolved from earlier Chinese card games and domino games. The name "mahjong" means "sparrow" in Chinese, possibly referring to the clicking sound of tiles being shuffled.</p>
            
            <h3>Development & Spread</h3>
            <p>Mahjong became popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, spreading from China to Japan, Korea, and eventually the West. The game was introduced to America in the 1920s, where it became a social phenomenon, especially among women.</p>
            
            <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
            <p>In Chinese culture, mahjong is more than a game—it's a social activity that brings families and friends together. It's commonly played during festivals, family gatherings, and social events. The game teaches pattern recognition, probability, and strategic thinking.</p>
            
            <h3>Modern Popularity</h3>
            <p>Today, mahjong is played by millions worldwide. It's particularly popular in East Asia, where professional tournaments are held. The game has also gained popularity in the West, with various rule sets and online versions.</p>

            <h2>📋 Rules of Mahjong</h2>
            
            <h3>Basic Setup</h3>
            <p>Mahjong is typically played with 4 players using 144 tiles. The tiles are divided into suits (Bamboo, Characters, Circles), honor tiles (Winds, Dragons), and bonus tiles (Flowers, Seasons).</p>
            
            <h3>Tile Categories</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Suits:</strong> Three suits (Bamboo, Characters, Circles) numbered 1-9</li>
                <li><strong>Winds:</strong> East, South, West, North (4 of each)</li>
                <li><strong>Dragons:</strong> Red, Green, White (4 of each)</li>
                <li><strong>Flowers/Seasons:</strong> Bonus tiles (4 of each)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deal:</strong> Each player receives 13 tiles (14 for the dealer)</li>
                <li><strong>Turn:</strong> Draw a tile, then discard one</li>
                <li><strong>Melds:</strong> Form sets of 3 (Pung/Chow) or pairs</li>
                <li><strong>Winning:</strong> Complete a hand with 4 melds + 1 pair (14 tiles total)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Melds</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pung:</strong> Three identical tiles</li>
                <li><strong>Kong:</strong> Four identical tiles</li>
                <li><strong>Chow:</strong> Three consecutive tiles of the same suit</li>
                <li><strong>Pair:</strong> Two identical tiles (needed for winning)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Winning Conditions</h3>
            <p>A winning hand consists of 4 melds (Pung, Kong, or Chow) plus 1 pair. Special hands may have different requirements. The first player to complete a valid hand wins the round.</p>

        <div id="strategy" class="tab-content">
            <h2>🎯 Strategy & Tactics</h2>
            
            <h3>Tile Efficiency</h3>
            <p>Discard tiles that are least useful for forming melds. Keep tiles that can form multiple potential melds. Avoid discarding tiles that help opponents complete their hands.</p>
            
            <h3>Reading Opponents</h3>
            <p>Watch what tiles opponents discard to understand their hand. If someone discards many tiles from one suit, they're likely not collecting that suit. Discarded honor tiles are usually safe to discard.</p>
            
            <h3>Defensive Play</h3>
            <p>If an opponent seems close to winning, switch to defensive play. Discard tiles that are less likely to help them. Sometimes it's better to avoid winning yourself if it means preventing an opponent's big win.</p>
            
            <h3>Offensive Play</h3>
            <p>When you have a strong hand, play aggressively. Keep tiles that complete your hand quickly. Don't be afraid to call (claim) tiles from other players if it speeds up your win.</p>
            
            <h3>Special Hands</h3>
            <p>Learn common special hands (like "All Pungs," "All Chows," "Seven Pairs") as they often score higher. However, they're harder to complete, so balance risk vs. reward.</p>
            
            <h3>Wind & Dragon Strategy</h3>
            <p>Winds and Dragons are valuable for forming melds but harder to complete. Keep them if you have pairs or can form melds, but don't hold onto them too long if they're not helping.</p>
