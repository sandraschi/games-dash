                <h2>📜 The Rules</h2>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Avoid being left with the Old Maid card (the unmatched card). The player left with it loses!</p>
                
                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove one queen from a standard 52-card deck (leaving 51 cards)</li>
                    <li>The remaining queen becomes the "Old Maid"</li>
                    <li>Deal all cards to players (some may have one extra card)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Play</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Discard pairs:</strong> All players remove matching pairs from their hand face-down</li>
                    <li><strong>Take turns:</strong> Players take turns offering their hand face-down to the player on their left</li>
                    <li><strong>Draw a card:</strong> The player draws one card (without looking) from the offered hand</li>
                    <li><strong>Make pairs:</strong> If the drawn card matches a card in hand, discard the pair</li>
                    <li><strong>Continue:</strong> Play continues until all pairs are discarded</li>
                    <li><strong>Loser:</strong> The player left with the Old Maid loses!</li>
                </ol>
