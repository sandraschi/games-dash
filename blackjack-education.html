                <h2>📖 Rules</h2>
                <h3>Basic Gameplay</h3>
                <p>Blackjack (also called 21) is a card game where you compete against the dealer. The goal is to get a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.</p>
                
                <h3>Card Values</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Number cards (2-10):</strong> Face value</li>
                    <li><strong>Face cards (J, Q, K):</strong> Worth 10</li>
                    <li><strong>Ace:</strong> Worth 1 or 11 (whichever is better for your hand)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Play</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place your bet</li>
                    <li>Dealer deals two cards to you and two to themselves (one dealer card is hidden)</li>
                    <li>If you get 21 (Ace + 10-value card), you have "Blackjack" and win 1.5x your bet (unless dealer also has Blackjack)</li>
                    <li>Choose your action:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hit:</strong> Take another card</li>
                            <li><strong>Stand:</strong> Keep your current hand</li>
                            <li><strong>Double Down:</strong> Double your bet and take exactly one more card (only on first two cards)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If you go over 21, you "bust" and lose immediately</li>
                    <li>After you stand, dealer reveals their hidden card and must hit until they reach 17 or higher</li>
                    <li>Compare hands - closest to 21 without going over wins</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Winning Conditions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blackjack (21 with first two cards):</strong> Pays 3:2 (1.5x bet)</li>
                    <li><strong>Beat dealer's hand:</strong> Pays 1:1 (double your bet)</li>
                    <li><strong>Tie (Push):</strong> Your bet is returned</li>
                    <li><strong>Dealer busts:</strong> You win even if you busted</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>🎯 Strategy</h2>
                <h3>Basic Strategy (The Foundation)</h3>
                <p>Blackjack has mathematically optimal play called "basic strategy." Following it reduces the house edge to about 0.5%.</p>
                
                <h3>When to Hit</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hand value 5-11: Always hit</li>
                    <li>Hand value 12-16: Hit if dealer shows 7 or higher</li>
                    <li>Soft hands (Ace + low card): More flexible - can hit without risk of busting</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>When to Stand</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hand value 17-21: Always stand</li>
                    <li>Hand value 12-16: Stand if dealer shows 2-6 (dealer likely to bust)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>When to Double Down</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hand value 9, 10, or 11: Double if dealer shows 2-9</li>
                    <li>Soft 13-18: Double if dealer shows 4-6</li>
                    <li>Only double on your first two cards</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Advanced Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hard hand:</strong> No Ace, or Ace counts as 1</li>
                    <li><strong>Soft hand:</strong> Ace counts as 11 (can't bust on next card)</li>
                    <li><strong>Card counting:</strong> Advanced technique (not applicable in online games with continuous shuffling)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Taking insurance (bad bet - 5.8% house edge)</li>
                    <li>Standing on 12-16 when dealer shows 7-Ace</li>
                    <li>Not doubling down on 10 or 11</li>
                    <li>Playing by "gut feeling" instead of basic strategy</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>📚 History</h2>
                <h3>Origins</h3>
                <p>Blackjack's origins are debated, but it likely evolved from several European card games in the 17th-18th centuries. The Spanish game "Veintiuna" (21) and French "Vingt-et-Un" (21) are early ancestors.</p>

                <h3>Name Origin</h3>
                <p>The name "Blackjack" comes from a special bonus payout in early American casinos. If a player got a black Jack (Jack of Spades or Clubs) with an Ace of Spades, they received a 10:1 bonus. This bonus was later removed, but the name stuck.</p>

                <h3>Modern Blackjack</h3>
                <p>Blackjack became the most popular casino card game in the 20th century, especially after:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1962:</strong> Edward Thorp published "Beat the Dealer" introducing card counting</li>
                    <li><strong>1970s:</strong> Basic strategy became widely known</li>
                    <li><strong>1990s:</strong> Online blackjack made the game accessible worldwide</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cultural Impact</h3>
                <p>Blackjack is featured in countless movies (Rain Man, 21, The Hangover) and is the casino game most associated with skill and strategy. The MIT Blackjack Team's story became legendary.</p>
