# AI Games Collection MCP - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 3.0.0
**Date:** 2026-03-29
**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION-READY**

---

## Executive Summary

AI Games Collection MCP is a state-of-the-art Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed for recursive game analysis, industrial-grade coaching, and decentralized P2P multiplayer orchestration. By bridging high-fidelity game engines (Stockfish, Yaneuraou, KataGo) with a real-time synchronization layer (Firebase), AI Games Collection MCP enables globally synchronized agentic game-play.
