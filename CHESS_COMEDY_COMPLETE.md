## Egregious Movie Examples (Confirmed!)

### Board Setup Disasters (40% of movies!)

1. **Austin Powers (1999)** - Board backwards, Russian character! (Irony: 10/10)
2. **Shawshank Redemption (1994)** - Board backwards, meticulous character!
3. **Silence of the Lambs (1991)** - Board backwards, detail-oriented scientists!
4. **The Seventh Seal (1957)** - Board backwards, iconic Death scene!
5. **Blade Runner (1982)** - Used real "Immortal Game" but setup errors

### Other Errors

6. **2001: Space Odyssey (1968)** - HAL's mate announcement slightly off (but 95% accurate!)
7. **Harry Potter (2001)** - "Checkmate!" when position isn't mate (but otherwise good!)
8. **The West Wing** - "Fibonacci sequence" in chess?! (term doesn't apply)

## The "Instant Mate" Trope - Reality vs. Fiction

### What's ACTUALLY Possible

| Mate Depth | Human Time | Realistic? | Movie Use |
|------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Mate in 1 | 0.1-1 sec | ✅ YES | Believable |
| Mate in 2 | 1-5 sec | ✅ YES | Believable |
| Mate in 3 | 5-30 sec | ✅ POSSIBLE | Acceptable (if 5-10 sec) |
| Mate in 5 | 1-5 min | ⚠️ NEEDS TIME | Not instant |
| Mate in 10 | 5-15 min | ⚠️ CALCULATION | Definitely not instant |
| Mate in 15 | 15+ min | ❌ IMPOSSIBLE INSTANT | Computers only |
| Mate in 2241 | 🤣 ABSURD | 🤣 COMEDY | Ridiculous AI |
