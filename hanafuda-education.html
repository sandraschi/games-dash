            <h2>📜 History of Hanafuda</h2>
            
            <h3>Portuguese Origins</h3>
            <p>Hanafuda (花札, "flower cards") originated in Japan during the Edo period (1603-1868). The cards were developed after Portuguese playing cards were banned by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1633. To circumvent the ban, Japanese card makers created cards without numbers or Western suits.</p>
            
            <h3>Cultural Adaptation</h3>
            <p>Instead of numbers, hanafuda cards feature beautiful artwork representing the 12 months of the year, each associated with a specific flower or plant. The cards became deeply integrated into Japanese culture, appearing in art, literature, and festivals.</p>
            
            <h3>Nintendo's Beginnings</h3>
            <p>Nintendo, now famous for video games, started as a hanafuda card manufacturer in 1889. The company's first product was hand-painted hanafuda cards. Nintendo still produces hanafuda cards today, maintaining this traditional connection.</p>
            
            <h3>Modern Popularity</h3>
            <p>Hanafuda remains popular in Japan, especially during New Year celebrations. The game has also spread to Korea (where it's called "Hwatu") and Hawaii (where it's called "Sakura"). Various video game adaptations have introduced hanafuda to international audiences.</p>

                <li><strong>Turn:</strong> Play a card from hand, match it with a card on the table (same month), then draw a card</li>

                <li><strong>Koi-Koi:</strong> After forming a yaku, you can call "Koi-Koi" to continue or stop to claim points</li>

            <h2>🎯 Strategy & Tactics</h2>
            
            <h3>Yaku Recognition</h3>
            <p>Learn the common yaku (scoring combinations) to recognize when you have a winning hand. Common yaku include "Five Brights," "Four Brights," "Boar, Deer, Butterfly," and various ribbon combinations.</p>
            
            <h3>Card Counting</h3>
            <p>Keep track of which months have been played. This helps you know what cards are still available and what yaku are still possible. Remember that each month has 4 cards total.</p>
            
            <h3>Koi-Koi Decision</h3>
            <p>Deciding when to call "Koi-Koi" (continue) vs. stopping is crucial. If you have a strong hand with multiple potential yaku, continuing can be worth the risk. If your hand is weak, stopping early may be safer.</p>
            
            <h3>Defensive Play</h3>
            <p>If your opponent is close to winning, play defensively. Avoid playing cards that help them complete yaku. Sometimes it's better to break up your own potential yaku to prevent an opponent's win.</p>
            
            <h3>Bright Cards</h3>
            <p>Bright cards are valuable but also risky. Holding multiple brights can lead to "Five Brights" (highest scoring yaku), but if you can't complete it, you may waste valuable cards.</p>
            
            <h3>Month Priority</h3>
            <p>Some months are more valuable than others. Months with bright cards (January, March, August, November, December) are particularly important. Prioritize collecting these when possible.</p>
